Explanation on how to run scripts in this folder to reproduce scores in the submitted paper.

First, you have to download the input files at 
It was not possible to upload them here as the size of the files easily exceeds what is allowed in GitHub.
These files were generated by running the script "run_all_classifiers.py" using the original datasets, that cannot be shared here but can be downloaded using references provided in the paper.

The folder contains the following scripts:
- mandala_couples.py, which can be used to compute the classification performance of a 2-classifier ensemble (Section 6 of the paper)
- mandala_analyzer.py, which can be used to compute MAND and MAND* ensembles (Section 6 of the paper).
- mandala_diversitymetrics.py, which can be used to compute diversity metrics (including disagreement) of couple of classifiers (Section 6 of the paper).
- mandala_diversitymetrics.py, which can be used to compute diversity metrics (including disagreement) of couple of classifiers (Section 6 of the paper).

Then, you can generate the results in Section 4.6 by using the script "run_all_classifiers.py" and processing big datasets as explained in the paper.
